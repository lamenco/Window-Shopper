                    <p>Kömmerling 70 mm is a 5-chamber system with 70 mm construction depth for the production of plastic windows. The specific technical feature here is the innovative, steel reinforcement with patented geometry with extremely good thermal insulation properties. <br>

                        With its numerous geometries of crates, wings, campfers and flying dividers, the system offers an almost unlimited field for architectural fantasy.<br>

                        It meets the highest requirements in terms of heat and noise insulation. The fittings installed in the profile system and wrapped in the reinforcement offer a high degree of basic anti-burglary. The levels of anti-burglary of class 1 and class 2 are reached without any problems.<br>

                        The system is also an example in terms of environmental friendliness: As a first world-renowned manufacturer, the KÖMMERLING brand, in parallel with recycled material, began to include in its production process exclusively and only fresh lead-free PVC with "green" calcium-zinc-based stabilizers.<br>
