Window and Door Calculator Application
Welcome to the Window and Door Calculator application! This is a web-based tool built using the Spring framework, MySQL database, and Thymeleaf templating engine. 
The application allows users to estimate the approximate cost of windows and doors for their projects. It also features user authentication and authorization through Spring Security, with roles defined as "Admin" and "User." 
Users can interact with the application by leaving comments on different window and door brands, facilitated by a Rest Controller. Additionally,
the application utilizes Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) to log user access timestamps when they navigate to specific links.
